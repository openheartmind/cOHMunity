# OHM Roadmap


## 🌳 Annual Growth Cycle

## 🔁 Weekly Growth Cycle (May 2025)
Within each monthly Council theme, we move through a full WisdOHM cycle — not just in thought, but in practice. We begin by recording what’s emerging. Then we evaluate, reflect, and report what we’ve learned. These four phases repeat each moonth — simple, steady, systemic — and weekly meetings are open to those who can commit to attending all four sessions within the cycle.
