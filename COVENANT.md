# OHM Covenant
*A shared commitment to fairness, care, and collective contribution*

## 1. Welcome
Open Heart & Mind (OHM) is a diverse community exploring new ways of living, working, and relating together. By participating in the OHM community ("cOHMunity") or using the Wisdom app, you are joining a collective experiment in open collaboration and fair recognition of value.

This Covenant outlines our shared purpose, values, and expectations. By engaging with Wisdom or contributing to OHM, you agree to uphold these principles.

## 2. Our Purpose
We aim to co-create regenerative, participatory, and transparent systems that support the commons and empower communities to coordinate with care, integrity, and autonomy.

## 3. Our Vision
We envision a globally distributed network of autonomous communities, coordinating their efforts through open, composable valuation and governance mechanisms. These systems empower people to contribute freely and to be fairly recognized and rewarded for the value they bring to one another and to society.

## 4. Our Mission
To realize this purpose, we are developing Wisdom —- a free, open-source tool for decentralized recognition and reward —- and Metavaluation, a circular framework for participatory community governance. 

These tools empower communities to record and assess diverse contributions, helping to recognize what matters, reward contributions toward the common good, and build more transparent and inclusive systems of coordination.

## 5. Our Values
OHM is inspired by the Open Science, Burning Man and Permaculture movements. In May 2025, we ran a "value mapping" experiment to prioritise values with respect to our collective mission (read more on this experiment [here](https://github.com/openheartmind/cOHMunity/wiki/Values)). The top 10 values identified were:

1. Integrity
2. Consent
3. Regeneration
4. Care
5. Respect
6. Transparency
7. Decentralization
8. Community
9. Creativity
10. Gifting

We welcome ongoing dialogue about how our values guide our practices, and will continue to iterate on this list as our community, system and framework evolve.

## 6. Participating in OHM
We welcome contributions of all kinds that advance the OHM mission —— technical, creative, emotional, logistical, or relational. These may include:
- Developing or improving software
- Facilitating gatherings or care practices
- Coordinating or administrating projects
- Creating art, research, or documentation
- Offering feedback, mentorship, or financial support

We recognize that value comes in many forms, and are working to honor them all.

Participation is always voluntary. We encourage you to contribute freely, without expectation of return —— while trusting that are working toward fairly recognising all contributions in due course.

## 7. Using Wisdom
Wisdom is our open-source tool for recording and valuing contributions. Community members can:
- Nominate contributions by themselves or others
- Review contributions through pairwise comparisons
- Earn recognition for their reviews and other contributions

Contributions are evaluated across multiple dimensions (e.g., "Gratitude" or "Value to the Mission"), producing collective measures of relative value.

We may also recognise the value of 'negative' contributions, such as payments to members from the collective treasury. If you wish to nominate someone for a negative interaction —— such as violations of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openheartmind/cOHMunity/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) —— we ask that you first [contact project administrators to discuss](mailto:admin@openheartmind.org).

## 8. Feedback and Disagreement
If you feel that a contribution has been misrepresented or unfairly treated in any way, you can:
- Submit feedback through community channels
- Join the valuation process to influence outcomes
- Contact project administrators to discuss

All data should be interpreted with humility, care, and a spirit of continuous improvement.

## 9. Rewards and Reputation
We may also use Wisdom data to generate reputation metrics, representing the value of contributions over time. These scores may inform governance roles or access to shared resources. However, they are not absolute and should not be treated as measures of personal worth.

Some participants may also receive financial or symbolic rewards in the future, based on community valuation. Any such rewards should be considered gifts (or honorariums) from the community, rather than payment for services or goods. Participants should contribute freely, without expectation of return.

## 10. Respect and Accountability
We strive to foster a culture where everyone feels heard, valued, and supported.

**Our Pledge:**

We as members, participants, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

All members of our community are expected to:
- Treat others with kindness, empathy, and integrity
- Honor diverse identities, experiences, and viewpoints
- Refrain from harassment, abuse, or discriminatory behavior
- Give and receive feedback with care
- Take responsibility for mistakes and seek to repair harm

These expectations apply in all community spaces —— online and offline —— and extend to all uses of the Wisdom platform. For behavioral standards, reporting procedures, and enforcement guidelines, please see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openheartmind/cOHMunity/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 11. Drug & Alcohol Policy
OHM Gathering is a drug- and alcohol-free event. The use of drugs or alcohol is strictly prohibited in all shared spaces, including workshops, dancefloors, dining areas, campfires, open paddocks, the hot tub, and the swimming hole.

Your personal campsite is your own space and will not be policed. However, we encourage all participants to honour the collective atmosphere by abstaining from drugs and alcohol throughout the Gathering, and instead explore the many healthier, community-supported pathways for connection and regulation.

Anyone showing signs of intoxication or drug use in common spaces will be cautioned by community members and, in serious cases, asked to leave the event.

## 12. Agreement Clause
By participating in OHM or using the Wisdom platform, you agree to:
- Uphold this Covenant
- Abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openheartmind/cOHMunity/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and its enforcement mechanisms
- Contribute in good faith and with care for others
- Accept that contributions and other interactions may be evaluated by the community
- Provide or receive feedback in a respectful, constructive manner

Your participation signals a commitment to building a shared culture of fairness, inclusion, and mutual respect.

## 13. Questions or Concerns?
If you have questions, need support, or wish to report harm, please email admin[at]openheartmind.org

## 14. Revision and Stewardship
This Covenant is a living document. We aim to provide reasonable notice of substantial changes when practical, but reserve the right to modify this document at any time without notice. Continued participation in OHM or use of Wisdom after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified Covenant.
